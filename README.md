# Qt2048
A clone of the 1024 game by [Veewo Studio](https://web.archive.org/web/20140328011720/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.veewo.a1024 ""). The most popular JavaScript version of this game was done by [Gabriele Cirulli](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048). 

This version is for any target supported by Qt. Currently it was tested on Windows desktop only. Planned features:

* Settable board size (currently the board size is set to 4x4 tiles)
* Webassembly version for the browser
* API for remote user interfaces, AI bots, or whatever
* Multi-user server with a bitcoin earning scheme for the best performers.
